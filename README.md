# Simple Shooter Game

This repository contains a small 2D shooter built with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). The gameplay is inspired by classic arcade shooters, but all of the code and assets are original.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or newer
- `pygame` library (`pip install pygame`)

## Running the Game

```
python3 main.py
```

Use the arrow keys (or `A`/`D`) to move your ship and press the space bar to shoot. Avoid incoming enemies and try to achieve a high score!

The game prints the final score after you close the window.
